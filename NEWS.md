SkeletonComparativeEffectStudy Q1 2022
======================================

Changes:

1. Using `CohortGenerator` package to generate cohorts. This does mean several other tables will be created to hold cohort creation statistics.

2. Checking whether `tempEmulationSchema` is provided for those DBMSs that need it.

3. Checking if `andromedaTempFolder` can be created.

4. Fetching vocabulary version, study package version, and observation period range when exporting database meta-data.

5. Using new `ParallelLogger`, so changing all `ParallelLogger::logInfo()` to `message()` for prettier code.

6. Normalizing all paths, so there should be no issue when relative paths are used.

7. Using `keyring` in example code.

8. Updating `renv.lock` to latest versions of all dependencies.
