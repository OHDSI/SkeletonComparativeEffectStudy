This document describes the data model for storing the output of the comparative effectiveness analyses.

Fields with minimum values
==========================

Some fields contain patient counts or fractions that can easily be
converted to patient counts. To prevent identifiability, these fields
are subject to a minimum value. When the value falls below this minimum,
it is replaced with the negative value of the minimum. For example, if
the minimum subject count is 5, and the actual count is 2, the value
stored in the data model will be -5, which could be represented as '\<5'
to the user. Note that the value 0 is permissible, as it identifies no
persons.

These fields have been marked with \* in the preceding diagram, and are
noted 'with min value' in the Type column in the table definitions
below.
